It is finally getting warm out here and Shikanji is starting to make an appearance!
This Indian Limeade has Just 7 Ingredients, is Zesty, and so refreshing.
A hint of spices such as cumin and kala namak (yes that egg flavored Indian sulphur salt!) add a fabulous flavor to this drink.
Lime is the choice of citrus but lemon makes a great shikanji too.
Make sure to make a large pitcher worth as everyone will fight over it!
WHAT IS SHIKANJI / NIMBU PANI?
Shikanji or Shikanjvi or Nimbu Pani is a limeade like drink made in several regions in India.
Nimbu Pani literally tranlates to lime water.
Summers bring tropical heat, water loss with all the sweating and thirst!
Shikanji is the best thirst quencher in those days or any day for that matter.
The ingredients vary a bit depending on family or regional influence.
You can add or remove to preference.
It makes a great re-hydration drink to rejuvenate and refresh.
INGREDIENTS FOR SHIKANJI
Lime: is the citrus of choice generally for shikanjvi.
It is fresh, zesty.
Chaat Masala or other souring additions: Along with lime, there is usually additional sour added to the drink.
Indian Chaat Masala(which contains kala namak, dry mango powder, cumin, ground ginger etc).
Or use kala namak, the eggy sulphur salt is used for its sour flavor here and not the egg flavor, or Amchur (dry mango powder).
You can use either of these 3 or just add more lime to taste.
Salt: Salt is generally added to the drink as salts are needed for rehydration when you have been sweating and losing salts from the body.
You can use less or more to preference.
Sugar/Sweetener: Balances out the sour and salty flavor.
Ground Cumin: Ground toasted cumin adds a subtle toasty earthy flavor that goes very well with the lime.
You can use regular ground cumin, or use ground coriander or just omit.
Black pepper: helps clear up the sinuses even in the tiny amount.
Add less or more or omit.
Make this into a Cocktail!: Vodka, Rum or gin work well with this sour lime drink.

What do you do when its too hot but you are craving some masala chai.
Make Iced Masala Chai! And then since you are a blogger, you amp it up with turmeric milk to make Turmeric Iced Tea ;).
This is a turmeric and spiced version inspired by a Thai Iced tea.
Turmeric is a warming and drying spice.
Too much tastes bitter and also dries one up.
Use to taste preference.
Bring your tea to a boil with the masala chai spices and fresh ginger.
I use my Chai Masala Spice from my book.
Cool and strain.
Prepare your turmeric coconut milk, Or use plain coconut milk (let me know what you loved!).
Pour tea in a glass full of ice cubes.
Pour some turmeric milk.
Serve immediately.
This tea also works great hot.
Add the turmeric coconut milk in the hot tea.

It is finally getting hot around here enough to call for using those ice cubes from the freezer.
And of course summer = mango, and pitchers of cold fun drinks!
This Mango Majoti is refreshing and great for quenching that thirst in the heat.
Add alcohol or not.
I often serve it without because the mango lime and mint tastes so amazing together.
Use other fruit juice or purees instead of mango like pineapple, strawberries, lychee, any summer fruits.
Some fresh lime, fresh mint, mango juice or puree, water or club soda if needed, loads of ice cubes.
Yes!
While you are here, please also join me in taking action to help the Precious 4 Elephants.
4 elephants (one of who is blind) that were recently rescued by Wildlife SOS from a circus were taken back by the circus forcefully.
Other animals like horses and dogs were taken back as well.
I cannot begin to imagine the confusion these animals must be going through.

Vegan Indian Masala Chai.
Fabulous almond milk tea with fresh ginger and homemade chai spice blend with cardamom, cinnamon, pepper.
Flavorful traditional Indian Chai tea made vegan.
Jump to Recipe.
Masala Chai was the last of the non-vegan foods to be eliminated from our diet.
Hubbs and me both grew up  guzzling cups of chai every morning with breakfast.
It would be mostly milk and lightly flavored with tea till we hit the teens,
then it was small cups every now then with friends, every time we visited anyone, at evening hang outs, in the wee hours of the morning during exams, and on and on.
Dad still has a cup every 2-3 hours at work.
No wonder we were so stuck to it, or more stuck to the dairy in it.
The thick creamy concoction made with dairy milk, boiled for minutes and minutes, had not only the addiction from milk and tea but also several memories associated with it.
I have an older post with a creamer that was the recipe we settled on in the initial transition year.
And now after trying several other plant milk options, this is our current vegan chai.
The recipe works well with other almond milks and soy milk too.
